[2020-09-13 23:06] test.
this will be a new thing.

[2020-09-14 08:58] so i've decided.
this will be my new way of posting updates about myself, among other things.
i just woke up, and i'll probably start my day in a little bit. i woke up kinda late so there's a small problem there, but we'll cross that when the time comes.

[2020-09-14 16:14] i'm really tired.
i don't know if i slept poorly last night, but i just feel like shit at the moment. i still have stuff to do that can't wait until later though. i honestly doubt i will have the time to rest until tonight.

[2020-09-14 22:48] well that last entry was depressing.
anyways, i was able to take a nap in the end, and i was actually able to get some things done! it made me glad in the end so i feel like today was in general pretty good. i'll be going to sleep right now, and i HOPE that it will be a good rest for once.

if not, then i guess it's okay. i'll take a nap later on if i have to.
